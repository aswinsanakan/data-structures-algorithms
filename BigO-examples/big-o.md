# Big O

Calculates time complexity of a program.

## O(n) - Linear time

When the number of operations increase as the number of elements increase (directly proportional).

## O(1) - Constant time

Number of operations stays 1 even when number of elements increase.

## O(n^2) - Quadratic time

Performance is directly proportional to the squared size of the input data set (think of Linear, but squared).
Ex: When nesting over multiple iterations of same data sets

# Big O Rule book

- Rule 1: Always worst case
- Rule 2: Remove constants
- Rule 3: Differentiate terms for inputs (Ex: (O(a+b))
- Rule 4: Drop non dominants
